                            <b>Project Type&nbsp;&nbsp;:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial and service mall.<br>
                            <b>Total Area&nbsp;&nbsp;:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The project occupies an area of 11,000 square meters.<br>
                            <b>Number of Floors&nbsp;&nbsp;:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The mall consists of five floors.

•	Basement: This floor serves as a garage with the capacity to accommodate 100 cars and includes a supermarket store.<br>
•	Lower Ground Floor: This floor is described as "low-height," but its specific purpose or use is not mentioned. Typically, lower ground floors in malls may house facilities like storage, maintenance areas, or utility spaces.<br>
•	Upper Ground Floor: This floor is described as "high-height." It's common for this floor to include anchor stores, larger retail spaces, or entrances to the mall.<br>
•	First Floor: The first floor is dedicated to shops. This is where various retail outlets or stores are typically located, catering to shoppers.<br>
•	Last Floor: The last floor serves as apartments for management, which can be used as clinics or offices for companies. This indicates a mixed-use aspect of the mall, combining commercial and service functions.<br>
As an architecture engineer for the owner, my role involves creating and revising shop drawings, ensuring quality standards are met, and approving subcontractor invoices. I oversee the construction process to align it with the owner's vision, budget, and quality expectations.
