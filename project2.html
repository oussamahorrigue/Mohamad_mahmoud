                            The site for the self-build housing scheme is located at 337-357 Kingsland Road, in Hackney.
                            The
                            site features a triangular shape with one edge adjacent to the bustling Kingsland road and
                            one
                            running along Enfield Road. The short edge of the site is positioned against the sidewall of
                            the
                            neighbouring building – Metropolitan house, which was built in 1886 as a hospital, now is
                            used
                            as a hostel and business centre. On the opposite side of the site is located a newly
                            finished
                            housing tower designed by Henley Hale-Brown. The site faces a crescent line of terraced
                            houses.
                            The site is based in the proximity of green public spaces such as Stonebridge Gardens and De
                            Beauvoir Square.

                            Students were asked to work in teams to define an urban condition and massing in order to
                            split
                            the site between each member. The proposal consists of two elongated rectangular buildings
                            each
                            placed along two main streets, in consequence separating public areas from the private
                            communal
                            garden inside. A shorter building located along Enfield Road allows sunlight from the south
                            to
                            reach the garden. The building contains 13 single storey apartments and 2 maisonettes as
                            well as
                            a nursery for local residents. Two buildings come together at the acute angle of the site to
                            form the main entrance to the garden and public space in front. The project focuses on the
                            characteristics of the linear block based along Kingsland road which provides a total of 32
                            apartments. The project intended to deliver a mix of affordable compact dwellings to satisfy
                            different lifestyles of residents and at the same time ensure its self-build objective.

                            On the ground floor are located 4 two-bedroom apartments as well as a café, entrances to the
                            private garden, entrances to the building cores, bike storages and bin storages. All of the
                            apartments have an entrance from the garden and are lifted from the street level to provide
                            maximum privacy for the rooms facing the street. Bathrooms have a roof light for ventilation
                            purposes but it also allows a slight amount of daylight from the lightwell above. On the
                            first
                            and second floor are located 10 two storeys maisonettes. Each of them has two bedrooms on

                            The same system is used on the next two floors yet it has a more traditional layout
                            of rooms with living and kitchen on the lower floor and bedrooms above. On the fifth floor
                            are
                            located 8 one-bedroom flats. Bathrooms and kitchens on all floors have windows to the light

                            the
                            building also implements a shared balcony space for the apartments facing the street and a
                            communal roof terrace with a view of the garden. The proposed design delivers a range of
                            different types of dwellings to meet resident’s various living needs. However compact floor
                            plan

                            The difference in the two main elevations highlights the opposite character of the street
                            side
                            and garden side of the building. The elevation facing Kingsland Road is more visually and
                            acoustically enclosed, with smaller windows and solid balcony walls. This decision is a
                            consequence of the less private essence of the busy street. The see-through element on the
                            balcony balustrade doesn’t block the view when a person is seated while still maintaining a
                            level of separation. West elevation is looking into the private garden within the scheme
                            which
                            recognise the need for a more open type. A considerably larger amount of glazing provides a
                            view
                            as well as south-west daylight.

                            The building features a 6 storey timber structure with a concrete foundation. The tectonic
                            strategy for the project was influenced by the regular grid of 3.6m of structural walls
                            parallel
                            to the short edge of the building. This quality allowed for an uncommon system for a
                            mid-rise
                            building which is a traditional timber framing. 150x50mm studs are used for balloon farming
                            for
                            exterior and load-bearing walls placed 400mm centres from each other. Wherever continuity of
                            structural wall is broken, because of wall openings, a beam is being introduced to ensure
                            sturdiness. Stud walls contain noggings for additional rigidity strength. Noggings placement
                            at
                            1200mm and 2400mm height provide an opportunity for straightforward installation of standard
                            sheathing boards. Structure benefits from the use of CLT cores which eliminate shear forces
                            and
                            maintains the use of lightweight material. Floor joists are placed in 400 mm centres as well
                            and
                            align with the stud arrangement.

                            Another significant element of the elevation design is the use of two distinct materials.
                            Cloured cladding will become an outer skin of the building while the white render is applied
                            on
                            all surfaces distinct from the skin surface. Employment of while smooth material will help
                            with
                            light reflection in more shadowed spaces, such as light wells or balconies pushed into the
                            structure.
                            The intention for the facade was to identify the material and technique which supports quick
                            and
                            straightforward assembly. The material used for the external skin is a corrugated panel
                            system
                            made from semi-compressed fiber cement. Standard 3050mm panels with the required 200mm
                            vertical
                            overlap accurately cover the height of one floor. Furthermore, you are able to see the
                            vertical
                            divisions between the panel but horizontal overlaps are seamless so it doesn't change the
                            rhythm
                            of the windows on the elevation.
                        </p>

                            The self-build aspect of the project at this scale is often associated with the procurement
                            process. However, the proposed design creates an opportunity for future residents to get
                            involved in the construction. The project requires seven skilled sub-contractors who will be
                            responsible for the work undertaken on the site and the supervision of self-builders.
                            Self-builders are expected to obtain CSCS (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) card as
                            proof of the completed training delivering the basic construction qualification. The use of
                            lightweight structural elements and easy straightforward fixings ensures a significant part
                            of
                            the job can be done without extensive knowledge just with the directions from the
                            contractor.
                            Moreover, interior walls within the apartments can be assembled by self-builders as well as
                            wall
                            linings as long as there are control checks made by the contractor. The compact nature of
                            the
                            apartments encourages residents to follow the proposed design yet some elements can be
                            adapted.
                            The most efficient layout of each apartment has been suggested in the project but the
                            structural
                            grid allows for flexibility when it comes to the placement of the interior walls.
